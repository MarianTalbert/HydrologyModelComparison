<h1>Graphics Catalog for Climate Primers</h1>
 
<br>
<h2>Marian Talbert, John Gross, Jeff Morisette</h2>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<br>
<p>This document is designed to demonstrate the graphics that we have made available for the North Central Climate Science Center to provide climate related graphics to describe the climate history as well as         projections for a specified area of interest.  Once you have specified your region of interest along with a few other parameters required for production of the graphics, this document will be generated with graphics for your region allowing you the opportunity to view the graphics, select the ones most appropriate for your interest as well as recommend any potential modifications using the accompanying graphics menu worksheet.  Please understand that all graphics are provided as a courtesy and while we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our graphics are accurate we cannot absolutely guaranteed that they are correct in every regard.</p>

<h4>Default Data sources</h4> 
<p>The data sources as well as the North Central Climate Science Center should be cited or acknowledged in any publications using these graphics.  Proper citations are provided in the references section.</p>  

<ul>
  <li> Historic: </li>
      <ul>
        <li> PRISM (4km)  downloaded from the <a href="http://cida.usgs.gov/thredds/dodsC/prism"> Geo Data Portal </a>.  The data is documented on the <a href="http://prism.oregonstate.edu"> PRISM website </a> \cite{PRISM}.  PRISM is the default historic dataset for consideration of historic trends. </li>
        <li> Maurer (1/8 degree) was downloaded from the G<a href="http://cida.usgs.gov/thredds/dodsC/prism"> Geo Data Portal </a> and documented on the <a href="http://www.engr.scu.edu/~emaurer/gridded_obs/index_gridded_obs.html"> Maurer Website </a> and is used for any graphics or tables comparing change from current to future conditions \cite{Maurer}.  This rather than PRISM is the appropriate dataset for this purpose because Maurer was used to downscale the projection data used in non-spatial graphics.  Because interpolated datasets disagree in some regions  there is a concern that changes between time periods could be due to changes in the base interpolated dataset  rather than due to the expected conditions for the time periods.  Maurer data is only available from 1950 to 2010 so the standard baseline used for PRISM (1895 to 2013) cannot be used when Maurer is the appropriate historic data set. </li>   
      </ul>
  <li> Projections: </li>
  <ul>
     <li> For non-spatial graphics CMIP5 projections as well as hydrologic monthly projections at 1/8th degree downscaled using BCSD for all emissions pathways and available.  Projections are downloaded from the Green Data Oasis by default.  More documentation regarding the CMIP5 multi-model dataset as well as the directions on how to cite this source for publications  is available at the <a href="http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/dcpInterface.html"> Green Data Oasis website </a> \cite{CMIP5}. </li>
     <li> For Spatial displays we use the 800m NEX CMIP5 monthly projections downloaded from <a href="http://dataserver.nccs.nasa.gov"> the NCCS website </a> \cite{NEX}. </li>
</ul>
</ul>



<h4> Non-spatial Displays </h4>
<p>Several non-spatial displays are generated to highlight the trends and changes in historic data as well projections using the CMIP5 climate models.  When possible we allow options to compare CMIP5 model output to interpolated datasets such as PRISM for your region.  Unless otherwise noted, all data is clipped to the region of interest and then averaged over the entire study area to produce time series graphics.  All Data is a monthly summary thus average temperature is average monthly temperature, minimum temperature is minimum monthly temperature and so on.</p>  

Seasons are broken down as follows:
<ul>
    <li> Winter = December, January, and February </li>
    <li> Spring = March, April, and May </li>
    <li> Summer = June, July, and August </li>
    <li> Autumn =September, October, and November </li>
</ul>

<h4> Spatial Displays </h4>
<p> By Default spatial displays for past data are generated using the most ap-
propriate historic dataset (Usually PRISM) and projections are generated
using the highest resolution available (NEX CMIP5). Default color scales
are based on the recommendations of Kaye et. al. Functions of any available
data can be produced with study area and state backgrounds added for large
study areas. </p>

\section{Spatial Displays}
By Default spatial displays for past data are generated using the most appropriate historic dataset (Usually PRISM) and projections are generated using the highest resolution available (NEX CMIP5).  Default color scales are based on the recommendations of Kaye et. al. Functions of any available data can be produced with study area and state backgrounds added for large study areas.
