<h1>Comparison of Hydrology variables from the GDO</h1>

<h4>Background</h4>
<br>
<p>It recently became apparent that there was a problem with the Snow Water Equivilant (SWE) output from the VIC model 4.1.2 especially in and around North Dakota. Near this general region two seperate scientists alerted me to issues with unrealistic model output which lead to an investigation.  The data in question is available on the Green Data Oasis and described under Hydrology (<a href="http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/dcpInterface.html">GDO</a>). The VIC model 4.1.2 was forced over the historic record with the gridded Maurer obserational data set (<a href="http://www.engr.scu.edu/~emaurer/gridded_obs/index_gridded_obs.html">Maurer</a>) as well as with CMIP5 climate model projections over a historic period and through the end of the 21st century.  An older version of the VIC model VIC 4.0.7 was also available on the GDO.  This model had similarly been foreced over the historic period with the gridded Maurer dataset as well as with the CMIP3 climate model projections and modeled historic data.  Previous efforts had provided a description of the differnt paramterizations of the two VIC models as well as a quantification of model specific differences though these primarilly focused on runoff and were not mapped across the entire spatial extent of the hydrology model output (<a href="http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/techmemo/BCSD5HydrologyMemo.pdf">BCSD5 Hydrology Memo</a>) </p>

<h4> Methods <h4>
<br>
<p> Because both models were forced over the historic period with the Maurer gridded observational dataset we were able to compare the two VIC models while controling for other sources of variation.  Initial mapping efforts reavealed extreme discrepancies especially in SWE for which over large swaths of the United States one model would report a SWE value three or more times that of the other VIC. Discrepancies were only slightly less pronouced for Runoff and Soil Moisture Content (SMC).  In an effort to determine which of the VIC models was reporting more realistic SWE values we downloaded the mothly data for all <a href="http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/">SNOTEL</a> stations across the United States as well as Satelite data output on SWE from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.  We could not find a strong relationship between the Satelite SWE output and any of the other data sources. <img src="C:\Users\mtalbert\Desktop\HydrologyProblem\HydroCode\HydroMapApp\www\PairsPlotLinesForStates.png" alt="PairsPlot" style="width:600px;height:600px;">

 and it became apprent that the areas of largest model discrepancy between the two VICs were spatially distant from the SNOTEL stations.  This made it difficult to make a determinitaiton as to the skill of either VIC model SWE output realtive to other data sources. </p>
