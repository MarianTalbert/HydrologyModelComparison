<h1>Comparison of Hydrology variables from the GDO</h1>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>It recently became apparent that there were large discrepancies between the Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) output from the VIC model 4.1.2 and the VIC model 4.0.7 which are available from the <a href="http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/dcpInterface.html">Green Data Oasis</a>.  The discrepancy was most notable in and around North Dakota. Near this general region two separate scientists alerted me to issues regarding unrealistic model output.  This led to a detailed comparison of the variables produced from these two VIC models.  The data in question is available on the Green Data Oasis and described in the about section under the Hydrology tab as well as in more detail in a separate memo (<a href="http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/techmemo/BCSD5HydrologyMemo.pdf">BCSD5 Hydrology Memo</a>) and thus will be described only briefly here. The VIC model 4.1.2 was updated from the older VIC version 4.0.7 model.  Both models were forced over the historic record with the gridded <a href="http://www.engr.scu.edu/~emaurer/gridded_obs/index_gridded_obs.html">Maurer</a> observational data set and both were additionally forced with hind-cast and future projections of CMIP model output to generate hydrology model projections based on projected climate conditions.  As the VIC model versions were updated so were the CMIP model ensembles thus VIC 4.0.7 was utilized to generate hydrology projections associated with CMIP3 and VIC 4.1.2 was used to generate projections associated with CMIP5.  Previous efforts had provided a description of the change in the paramterizations of the two VIC models as well as a quantification of model specific differences though these primarily focused on only the runoff variable and were not mapped across the entire spatial extent of the hydrology model output (<a href="http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/techmemo/BCSD5HydrologyMemo.pdf">BCSD5 Hydrology Memo</a>) </p>

<h4> Methods </h4>
<p> Because both models were forced over the historic period with the Maurer gridded observational dataset we were able to compare the two VIC models while controlling for other sources of variation.  Given the strongly skewed distribution of the variables output from the model, we elected to consider the ratio of the model's output after adding a constant to the numerator and denominator.  The skewed distribution of the variables led to a situation in which the raw difference between precipitation related variables was large enough in wet regions such as the north west to completely obscured differences throughout the rest of the modeled region (the difference was highly correlated with the absolute value of the variable itself).  Utilizing the ratio of the model output corrects the scale issue but introduces a new issue with random noise as the numerator and denominator approach zero thus necessitating the need for addition of a small constant to each. When considering the ratio of the variables the appropriate scale for plotting is the log scale which results in symetry for the situation in which one model is twice the other this issue has been discussed and resolved by <a href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/29/aje.kwr156.long">others</a>.</p>

<p>
Initial mapping efforts revealed extreme discrepancies especially in SWE for which over large swaths of the United States one model would report a SWE value three or more times that of the other VIC. Discrepancies were only slightly less pronounced for Runoff and Soil Moisture Content (SMC).  In an effort to determine which of the VIC models was reporting more realistic SWE values we downloaded the monthly data for all <a href="http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/">SNOTEL</a> stations across the United States as well as Satellite data output on SWE from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.  We could not find a strong relationship between the Satellite SWE output and any of the other data sources.  This could be due to the extremely coarse spatial resolution of the former relative to the latter or due to the fact that values were recorded mid-month rather than at the start of each month.  It became apparent that the areas of largest model discrepancy between the two VICs were spatially distant from the SNOTEL stations.  This made it difficult to make a determination as to the skill of either VIC model SWE output relative to other data sources.  There were strong relationships between the ratio of the two models and Latitude, Longitude, and Elevation as well as the interaction between these terms with VIC 4.0.7 being substantially larger in the higher Latitude lower elevation regions except in the western most locations and VIC 4.1.2 being substantially larger at the high elevations and along the west coast.  </p>
